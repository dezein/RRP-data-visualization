AMENDMENT
55. H.Amdt.123   — 102nd Congress (1991-1992)
Description: Amendment originally sought to delete sec. 1205 which authorizes funds for the United Nations Population Fund; and sec. 1206 which authorizes the use of funds for nongovernmental organization family planning assistance activities; and would have inserted language which denies funds to any organization or program which, as determined by the President, supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It would have prohibited funds to any foreign nongovernmental organization that performs or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning. \ As amended by the Kostmayer amendment (A003), the funding for the U.N. Population Fund was restored with certain restrictions including a limitation on assistance to the People's Republic of China. \ As amended by the Berman amendment (A004), language was added which specifies that U.S. government funds provided to nongovernmental organizations for family planning activities may not be used to perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning.
